Idea is to create a php class that is efficient in listing specific files in the given directory and to provide various ways of returning meaningfull data. 
One of the possible data returns would be a multidimensional array of file names paths, sizes and dimensions if these files are images.
basic usage will require some setup but the class will take care of everything else.
